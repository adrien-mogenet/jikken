## The Label

Jikken – Japanese word for “Experiment” – is a label that strives to defining styles that don’t really exist yet.

We’re interested in tracks and artists that can be hardly defined with the current paradigm.  We appreciate there’s already a large palette of existing genres, but we believe nothing is static, everything is ephemeral, and we want to shape the new rythms, synths, waveforms, arpeggios and other sonic content that will define tomorrow.


## Our guidelines

  * We strive to provide a solid guidance to our artists, help them define their projects and make intentionnal decisions when releasing their projects.
  * We want to break the rules.
  * There is _no_ rule to break the rules.
  * Encouraging experimentations does not mean we’re only accepting experimental projects.
  
If you can deal with that, please consider sending your demos!

## Demos

You can send your demos to this-demo-will-surprise-you [at] jikken-records [dot] com. We review _all_ the demos.
*Accepted formats*: any format that enables us to accurately appreciate your project.  If you have no idea, [Flac](https://xiph.org/flac/) is a great lossless opensource format, but a link to your favorite platform work too.


## Contracts

Renewing the industry also means cutting-edge label-artist relationships.  We want to offer a great experience to all our artists and we want to provide the best and fairest contracts.  No clause such as _“50% royalties after the first $100”_, we think that sucks.


## About us
Jikken has been founded in Tokyo in April 2020, incidentally amid worlwide Covid-19 outbreak.
