## The Label

_Jikken_ – Japanese word for “Experiment” – is a label that strives to define electronic styles that don’t really exist yet.

We’re interested in tracks and artists that can be hardly defined with the current paradigm.  We appreciate there’s already a large palette of existing genres, but we believe nothing is static, everything is ephemeral, and we want to shape the new rhythms, synths, waveforms, arpeggios and other sonic content that will define tomorrow.  We believe there are many great tracks classified as "techno, synthwave, IDM, industrial, etc." that are already pushing the boundaries of their genres, and it's precisely what we want to develop at Jikken Records.


## Our guidelines

  * We strive to provide solid guidance to our artists, help them define their projects and make intentional decisions when releasing their projects.
  * We want to break the rules.
  * There is _no_ rule to break the rules.
  * Encouraging experimentations does not mean we’re only accepting experimental projects.
  
If you can deal with that, please consider sending your demos!


## Demos

You can send your demos to this-demo-will-surprise-you [at] jikken-records [dot] com. There is **only one rule**, and it's to answer that question in your email: _What makes your project so special?_ We'll review _all_ the demos which follow that rule.
*Accepted formats*: any format that enables us to accurately appreciate your project.  If you have no idea, [Flac](https://xiph.org/flac/) is a great lossless opensource format, but a link to your favorite platform works too.


## Label/Artist relationships

Renewing the industry also means cutting-edge label/artist relationships.  We want to offer a great experience to all our artists and we want to provide the best and fairest contracts.  No clause such as _“50% royalties after the first $100”_, we think that sucks.  You may find it awkward to have a _Contracts_ section on the homepage of a label, but we want to be proud of that relationship.
