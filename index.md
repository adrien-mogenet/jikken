## Jikken Records

Jikken – Japanese word for “Experiment” – is a label that strives to defining styles that don’t really exist yet.

We’re interested in tracks and artists that can be hardly defined with the current paradigm.  We appreciate there’s already a large palette of existing genres, but we believe nothing is static, everything is ephemeral, and we want to shape the new rythms, synths, waveforms, arpeggios and other sonic content that will define tomorrow.

### Our guidelines

  * We strive to provide a solid guidance to our artists, help them define their projects and make intentionnal decisions when releasing their projects.
  * We want to break the rules.
  * There is no rule to break the rules.
  * Encouraging experimentations does not mean we’re only accepting experimental projects.
